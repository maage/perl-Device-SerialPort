- convert to Test::More
- split up tests so we can do non-device testing (as the default)

- fix AIX hardware flow control (what wrong?)
- fix lockfile support (how?)

- spread POD docs out across the module

- add a mechanism to set dtrrts etc in one swoop

- create a method to call "new" without a device name (cleaner way to test)

- make error handling behavior an option (don't die on device failure)
