Revision history for Perl extension Device::SerialPort.

0.22 (CVS) (Kees)
	- added a notice about 4096 read limits on some machines
	  noticed by Ed Morandi.
	- built an rpm .spec file with the help of cpan2rpm.
	- adding TESTPORT=... as a Makefile.PL option to not step on
          MakeMaker's feet.
	- making "modemtest" an installable script (which adds #! to top).
	- cleaning up "modemtest" args and output.
	- reversing configure report so "best" case reports "yes" for all.
	- handling ancient libcs with odd POSIX.pm _SC_CLK_TCK behavior
	  with diagnostic help from David Dyck
	- added test case explicitly for get_tick_count

0.21 2003-06-12 (Kees)
	- don't release files at midnight any more: forgot SerialPort.xs

0.20 2003-06-12 (Kees)
        - fixed some truth bugs found by David Dyck <david.dyck@fluke.com>
	- totally rewrote serial bit detection code to use "normal"
          perl XS routines.  Had to even toss in a "configure" script
          to make it really robust.
	- jumped up to version 0.20 just because it's just a big change
          to the build process.  Everything else appears undisturbed, but
          I want to give some time for testing it out on other
          architectures.

0.13 2002-05-31 (Kees)
	- added 'sys/modem.ph' for broken HPUX headers
        - fixed *BSD tiocmget and tick counts, care of
                joerg_wunsch@interface-systems.de
        - fixed the HPUX tioc* stuff, care of
                "Chang, Jerry" <Jerry.Chang@pyxis.com>

0.12 2001-10-24 (Kees)
